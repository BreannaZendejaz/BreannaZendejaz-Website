        <p class="lead mb-4">I am 20 years old and a current student at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Education with a Minor in English. I hope to pursue a career in teaching English at the High School Level. Teaching is something I want to pursue because I appreciate what my past teachers have done for me, such as giving me life advice while also educating me in terms of academics. As I was inspired by my past educators, I hope to be the same for another child in the future. I would want to teach English because of Literature in particular. Literature is timeless and I admire the room for interpretation compared to other subjects like math or science. 
<br><br>

        When I was in high school myself, I worked as a tutor for grades below me. Teaching is something I have a passion for and hope to show my abilities in the future. I had participated in several clubs in high schools such as Interact and the California Scholarship Foundation. Both clubs have impacted my views of the world and expectations of myself. In college, I took part in the Resident Hall Association where I held a position in Facilities. This gave me experience in planning and leadership. Now as a second year, I am part of the Sigma Pi Alpha Sorority. The organization revolves around the Sisterhood of Chicana students while being oriented in academics and being involved within our community. To be involved we partake in fundraisers around the school and also complete community service. Our philanthropy is ALS and we participate in walks to raise money. I wanted to continue doing community service after high school because I want to be involved and through community service, there are so many people I have met. Volunteering with the elderly is a completely different experience compared to volunteering with children. Itâ€™s an opportunity to give back while also gaining wisdom from those Iâ€™ve come across while also perhaps inspiring others.
<br><br>

        A bit about myself. Growing up I moved around a lot, exposing me to different types of people and cultures. I am a first-generation Mexican American. My mother is an immigrant who came in her early teen years and my father was born in the United States. Despite their educational status, both of my parents have worked their way up to high-level jobs in engineering. I have an older brother who graduated from Northern Arizona University and is now pursuing a career as a Software Engineer in Colorado. As for hobbies I enjoy art and music. Since I was young, I have played a wide range of instruments such as piano, guitar, saxophone, clarinet, and even drums. I also enjoy drawing and painting even though Iâ€™m not fantastic, but similar to literature, the meaning behind a piece is up for interpretation.
